 Orx build infos.
==================

Data to produce makefiles are stores in bakefiles in the corresponding sub-directory:
  - bakefiles/orx.bkl is the global bakefile which imports all other bakefiles in correct order.
  - bakefiles/common.bkl manages all configuration options.
  - bakefiles/lib.bkl produces the liborx and defines all common rules to use it.
  - bakefiles/main.bkl produces the orx program.
  - bakefiles/modules.bkl produces test modules.
  - bakefiles/plugins_core.bkl produces all core plugins.

The Bakefiles.bkgen is the descriptor which allows to produce some makefiles or project-files.

The autogen.sh is a bash script which generates all allowed makefiles and project-files according to Bakefiles.bkgen rules.
To product them, juste type in a shell :
 orx       > cd build
 orx/build > ./autogen.sh

Make sure you have bakefile-0.2.2 or newer installed.
