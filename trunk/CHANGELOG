Orx - Portable Game Engine  (Version 1.1 rc0)

=============================================================================

orx 1.1
-----
* Added orxCrypt command line tool for merging/encrypting/decrypting config files
* Added owner to spawner structure + all missing accessors for runtime handling
* Added associated clock to objects so as to allow localized time stretching (including sound pitch alteration)
* Clocks can now be created from config files and directly from objects. There can be only one clock with a given name (like cameras)
* IMPORTANT: Renamed spawner's WaveNumber property to WaveSize
* IMPORTANT: World gravity now use the physics dimension ratio -> update your config files accordingly
* orxCLOCK is now an orxSTRUCTURE
* Added timer handling functions in clock module
* Fixed aspect ratio correction when viewport was narrower than camera
* Added custom events for animations
* Integrated current Box2D version from its svn repository
* Added Raycast feature when physics is enabled (+wrappers in body & object modules)
* Dynamic objects can now have parents and get the cumulated result move from parents + physics simulation!
* Added a custom gravity as Body's property
* Physics simulation is back on main clock to provide a more robust game loop
* Fixed FixedRotation property to use Box2D feature instead of orx's hacked one
* Fixed orxVector_FromCartesianToSpherical() not getting the correct Rho when colinear to negative axes
* Added names of both involved parts in contact events
* Fixed orxFRAME child calculation when using anisotropic scale on parent
* Fixed home render plugin camera rotation when the camera has a parent object
* Removed AutoDelete property for spawners
* Added possibility for spawner to transmit or not parent's rotation & scale (by default it transmit them as before)
* Added orxObject_GetChild() / orxObject_GetSibling() for querying dependencies (for objects created through config's ChildList property only)
* Fixed config block value incorrectly saved by orxConfig_Save()
* Added the possibility to use empty config values either by using an empty line or a ;
* IMPORTANT: Due to the above change, block values must have the opening " on the same line as the key attribution: Key = "
* Config section inheritance can now easily be modified on-the-fly, at runtime (orxConfig_SetParent())
* Added 'screen' keyword for ShaderList properties
* Optimized shader lists processing when rendering objects & viewports
* Fixed tutorial #5 (viewport) jerkyness
* Sets default gravity to none in Box2D physics plugin
* Fixed use of AutoScroll/DepthScale with objects using bodies
* Changed tutorial #11 (spawner/shader) shader code
* Added orxDisplay_GetVideoModeCounter() / orxDisplay_GetVideoMode() / orxDisplay_SetVideoMode() & orxDisplay_IsVideoModeAvailable() (+SFML implementations)
* Renamed orxInput_GetBoundInputNumber() to orxInput_GetBoundInputCounter()
* Renamed orxStructure_GetNumber() to orxStructure_GetCounter()
* orxSystem module is now part of core (external library independent) and not a plugin anymore (+updated all configurations)
* When querying screen texture size, the latest display size will always be used
* Updated bounce demo to be able to change resolution on the fly (F1/F2) + ToggleFullScreen on F3
* Added orx_WinExecute() helper for console-less windows application
* Added __orxWII__ platform define for future work
* Added __orxIPHONE__ platform define for future work
* Misc updates & fixes

orx 1.0 final
-----
* Added fully featured localization module (orxLocale)
* orxTEXT that relies on the orxLocale module will now be automatically updated when changing language at runtime
* Updated screenshot module to work with config reloads
* Optimized some access to the config module
* Added acceleration parameter to FX curves (to controle their frequencies over time)
* Fixed flipped & tiled objects rendering
* Replaced all external uses of orxRGBA by orxCOLOR
* Events handlers are now expected to return orxSTATUS_SUCCESS so as to continue calling other handlers
* Added orxDisplay_SetFullScreen() and orxDisplay_IsFullScreen() functions + SFML implementation
* Improved some tutorials + added localization example in tutorial #10
* Misc minor updates in code & comments

orx 1.0rc1
-----
* Migrated all SFML plugins on all platforms to SFML 1.5: linux was using SFML 1.3, other platforms were using SFML 1.4
* Fixed the reload of config history: logic was broken and it could even crash
* Physics plugin now can handle negative scales (mirror effect)
* Fixed spawner not using scale when setting spawned object's relative speed
* Added orxLOG_CONSOLE(), orxLOG_FILE() and orxLOG_RAW() helpers
* Config section are not allowed anylonger to have leading or trailing spaces + trimmed all requests accordingly
* Fixed spawner wave timestamp not being correctly cleared when a spawner was reset
* Removed obsolete files
* Misc minor updates in comments/doc files

orx 1.0rc0
-----
* Initial release candidate for orx 1.0
